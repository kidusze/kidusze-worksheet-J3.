1. Polymorphism is a situation where a variable that is declared sometime at compile time can take different compatabile types of run time. Example of polymorphism is an Animal class wit different classifications like sound, verterbrate.

2. The variable u is a primitive type. The function u.toString allows for the value u to exhibit a polymorphic behavior. At compile time it is an object but at run time it could be a pointer,scanner or string. So u is dynamically bound at run time.

3. The output is A !!!

4. The output is "~~ B ~~" for both.

5. The output is "A" for both print statements.

6. It will not compile because the variable is restricted by the protected keyword and it was later called as a private which causes issues.

7. The output is A: 1

8. The output is  ``` foo1: B B ``` 

9. - ``` fluffy```  : "Name: fluffy Species: Canis Familaris" potentially Felius catus
   - ``` george ``` : "Name: george Species: Canis Familaris"
   - ``` brutus ``` : "Name: brutus Species: Felis Catus"

- **Difference Between a Class and an Abstract Class:**
  - A class is a blueprint for creating objects and can be instantiated directly. It can have concrete methods (methods with implementation) and abstract methods (which must be implemented by subclasses).
  - An abstract class, on the other hand, cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a base class for other classes, providing a common interface and shared behavior.
- **Why use an abstract class**
  - Code Reusability: Abstract classes can provide common functionality through concrete methods, which can be reused in all subclasses. This helps in reducing code duplication.
  - Encapsulation of Common Behavior: You can encapsulate common behaviors that should be shared across different types of objects (e.g., all types of animals in a zoo could inherit from an abstract Animal class).
- **Example in Software Engineering for Animals**
  - In a zoo management system, an abstract class Animal could include abstract methods like makeSound() and eat(), which all subclasses (e.g., Lion, Elephant, Giraffe) must implement. Common characteristics, such as isVertebrate(), can be defined as concrete methods in the abstract class, as all animals in the system may share these traits. 

12. The parent class would contain basic car elements like tires, steering wheels, gas pedal., gand break and cente console
For an abstract ``` Car ``` class:
- **Abstract methods:**
  - ``` startEngine() ``` : Since different types of cars (electric, gas-powered, etc.) may start in different ways, this method would be abstract, forcing subclasses to define how their engines start.
  - ``` fuelType() ``` : Abstract because different cars use different fuels (gasoline, electricity, etc.).
- **Concrete methods:**
  - ``` calculateMileage() ``` – This method might be common to all cars and can be implemented at the abstract class level with logic that applies universally.
  - ``` displayCarInfo() ``` – This method can be implemented in the abstract class to provide a standard way of displaying essential information about the car, such as its model, year, and color. This method can include common details that are relevant for all car types, ensuring consistency in how car information is presented across different subclasses.
